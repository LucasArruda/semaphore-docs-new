### Automatically parallelizing your test suite

As your project and test suite grow, feedback and results from your tests
gradually become slower, harming developer productivity. The easiest way to
solve this is to run tests in multiple jobs. On Semaphore, each job runs on a
separate virtual machine. Boosters enable you to get build results in a few
minutes by automatically splitting your tests across multiple jobs.

### How it works

Setting up Boosters doesn’t require introducing any new dependencies to your
application or making changes to your source code. Also, Boosters do not require
any maintenance. They continually adapt, changing how your tests are split across
jobs (machines) as your test suite grows and changes.

Semaphore runs your test files on multiple machines, e.g. if you have a 100 test
files and each takes 1 minute to execute, if Semaphore runs them across 10 jobs,
you should get results 10 times faster.

In practice, test files have different runtimes, so packing them across jobs in
a way that each job takes roughly same amount of time to complete is essential
for optimizing your build time. Semaphore Boosters know how to pack your test
files into separate jobs based on their duration. They do this based on a
history of runtimes for all the files in your test suite.

### Trying out Boosters

For more information on setting up and trying Boosters, check out our
[setting up Boosters documentation](/docs/setting-up-boosters.html).

### Will Boosters affect my current build configuration?

No, while you’re setting up Boosters, your project configuration and your
team’s work will not be affected in any way. If you decide to apply Boosters
configuration in the final step, only then will your project configuration be
changed for all users in your team.

### Are the boxes free?

All the boxes used during the Boosters setup are free. You will only need to
upgrade your account if you decide to add more boxes than you have in your
current plan.

### On which branch should I run the test?

You can run it on any green branch. It makes sense to use a branch that is not
the master branch.

### Which frameworks are supported?

Currently supported Ruby testing frameworks are RSpec and Cucumber.

### Troubleshooting

If any of these jobs turn red, that will not prevent you from continuing to set
up Boosters. Also, when you split up your test suite in such a random way, some
flakiness in your test suite can be more obvious. That’s something your team
will need to take care of.
