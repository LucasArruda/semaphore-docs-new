If you have turned Test file performance Insights on for a project on Semaphore,
but you don't see any test files on the Test file performance tab, or some stats
are missing, this guide will help you find the source of the problem.

Semaphore supports Test file performance Insights for RSpec and Cucumber testing
frameworks. If you are using some other framework, but you would still like to
use Test file performance Insights, please
[let us know](https://renderedtext.typeform.com/to/d1fWsl) by answering few
short questions.

## RSpec

At the moment, Semaphore supports only RSpec 3.x. If you are using earlier
versions of RSpec, it's likely that you will see test files in the Test file
performance tab, but you won't see all stats. Percentage of passed builds will
be visible, but stats for mean time, max time and standard deviation will be
missing. The solution to this problem is to upgrade to a newer version of RSpec.

If you use RSpec 3.x, but you don't see any test files in the Test file
performance tab, there are a few possible causes described below.

#### All test files finish faster than 10 seconds

Semaphore Test filer performance Insights are displayed only for test files that
take more than 10 seconds to finish.

#### Your options are defined with the SPEC_OPTS environment variable

There are a few ways to pass configuration options to RSpec runner:

- `SPEC_OPTS` environment variable
- `.rspec` file
- command line options

When you turn RSpec Test file performance Insights on on a project, Semaphore
will set the value of `SPEC_OPTS` environment variable:

```bash
export SPEC_OPTS="--format documentation --format json --out rspec_report.json"
```

However, if your project is using the `SPEC_OPTS` environment variable to pass
options to the RSpec runner, they will override the options that Semaphore
previously set and Semaphore will not be able to gather stats for the Test file
performance Insights.

A typical user RSpec command with the `SPEC_OPTS` environment variable might
look like this:

```bash
bundle exec rake spec SPEC_OPTS="--order random"
```

To use Test file performance Insights, replace the `SPEC_OPTS` environment
variable with an `.rspec` file.  You can commit the file to the repository.
In that case, these options will be used on all development machines, unless a
developer overrides them. If you don't want to commit the `.rspec` file to the
project repository, you can create the file using [configuration
files](/docs/adding-configuration-files.html). That way, the `.rspec`
file will be available only on Semaphore.

An alternative is to construct the `SPEC_OPTS` environment variable yourself.
The variable should include `--format json --out rspec_report.json` and all the
options you need.

#### Your tests are executed using parallel_test gem

If you run your RSpec tests using parallel_test gem, the report with stats for
each test example will not be in valid format, and you will not be able to use
Test file performance Insights. The issue is described in detail at the official
[parallel_tests issues](https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests/issues/266) page.

#### Your tests are executed using rspec_rerun gem

`rspec_rerun` gem is using a special formatter to save the report about failed
tests. When you turn on Test file performance Insights for a project that's
using `rspec_rerun`, Semaphore overrides the formatter used by `rspec_rerun`
and your tests will fail with an error such as:

```
Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - rspec.failures
```

To use RSpec Test file performance Insights in combination with `rspec_rerun`,
you need to set options for both Semaphore Test file performance Insights and
`rspec_rerun` in the `SPEC_OPTS` environment variable. Change your RSpec command
to look like this:

```bash
SPEC_OPTS="--format documentation --format json --out rspec_report.json --require rspec-rerun/formatter --format RSpec::Rerun::Formatter" bundle exec rake rspec-rerun:spec
```

After that, your tests should work as expected and Semaphore should be able to
collect Test file performance Insights data for the project.
