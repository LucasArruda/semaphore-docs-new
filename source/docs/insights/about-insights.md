Insights are a set of Semaphore features that provide metrics based on the
execution of you test suite.

## Speed Insights

Speed Insights show average build and waiting times for your project, based on
the last 100 builds.

To access Speed Insights, follow the **Insights** link on you project page, and
go to the **CI Speed** tab.

## Test files performance Insights

Test file performance Insights are a Semaphore feature which provides a report
on your slowest test files. Its goal is to give you useful feedback on your
continuous integration process.

With this feature, you can find out which files are the slowest and which ones
fail most often, and then use this data to enhance your test suite.

To get started with Test files performance Insights, you need to enable them for
the test frameworks you use in your project. Currently supported frameworks are
__RSpec__ and __Cucumber__.
